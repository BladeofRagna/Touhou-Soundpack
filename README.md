# Touhou-Soundpack
A small sound pack that changes some of KH2's system sound effects from the Touhou series

List of SFX that are replaced:
  - Getting a Drive Gauge
  - Getting MAX Drive
  - Using a Drive Form
  - Level Up
  - Dying/Game Over
  - Defeating a Boss
  - Menu Selection, Cancel, Move, and Error
  - Low HP Warning

More will likely be added later in the future!

Major thanks to TheNja09#0909 for helping me figure out how to do this stuff in the first place!
